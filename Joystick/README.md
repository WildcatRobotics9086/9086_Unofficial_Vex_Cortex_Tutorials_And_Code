# Controller
  When programming with a controller, all output ports are labeled.
## Buttons
  Buttons act like regular switches shown in the sensors section but have a different label for accessing their outputs.
## Joysticks
  The joysticks (channels 1, 2, 3, and 4) are the outputs with 1 and 2 being binded together while 3 and 4 are also binded. Imagine a graph with x and y coordinates, now replace your graph's x and y with the channel numbers, in essence that is the way that the joysticks will output. Ranging from (-100, -100) to (100, 100).
